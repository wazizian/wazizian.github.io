Inspired by entropic optimal transport, we proposed regularization strategies for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) that retain tractability while improving statistical behavior ([ESAIM COCV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08826)).

A second thread establishes **exact generalization guarantees** for regularized WDRO estimators ([NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17076), [slides](/assets/pdf/slides_neurips_2023.pdf)), bridging theory and the practice of robust learning.

Early iterations were shared at the [Erice 2022 workshop](https://workshopsperice2022.github.io/) ([slides](/assets/pdf/slides_sicile.pdf)), then refined for [FOCM 2023](https://focm2023.org/) ([poster](/assets/pdf/poster_wdro.pdf)) and [NeurIPS@Paris 2023](https://neuripsinparis.github.io/neurips2023paris/) ([slides](/assets/pdf/slides_neurips_in_paris_2023.pdf)).
