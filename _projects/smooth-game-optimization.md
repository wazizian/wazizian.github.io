With [Gauthier Gidel](https://gauthiergidel.github.io/), [Ioannis Mitliagkas](https://mitliagkas.github.io/) and [Simon Lacoste-Julien](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/), we propose a tight and unified analysis of gradient-based methods in games ([AISTATS 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05945), [slides](/assets/pdf/slides_aistats.pdf)) and leverage matrix iteration theory to study accelerated methods in games ([AISTATS 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00602)).
