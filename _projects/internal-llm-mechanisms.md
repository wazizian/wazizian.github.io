I had the chance of working with Michael Kirchhof, Eugene Ndiaye, Louis Bethune, Michal Klein, Pierre Ablin and Marco Cuturi while interning at [Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). We investigate how uncertainty estimates for LLMs behave under distribution shifts ([R2FM Workshop@ICML 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08572)).
While working at [Morgan Stanley Machine Learning Research](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/technology/machine-learning-research-team), I had the pleasure of collaborating with Ali Hasan to better understand the emergence of in-context learning in transformers. In particular, we study how the different properties of the pretraining distribution impact the in-context learning capabilities of transformers ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01163)).
