With [Marc Lelarge](https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/) I analyzed the approximation capabilities of invariant and equivariant graph neural networks, resulting in the ICLR 2021 paper [*Expressive power of invariant and equivariant graph neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15646).

The work clarifies how architectural constraints interact with group symmetries, and when additional structure is required to model combinatorial problems.

We showcased the findings at the [MIPT-UGA workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/mipt-uga-ai-workshop/home) and the Thoth seminar ([slides](/assets/pdf/slides_gnn.pdf)).
