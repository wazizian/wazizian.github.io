title: Last-iterate convergence of mirror methods
description: Determining how Bregman geometry impacts last-iterate guarantees in variational inequalities.
importance: 4

---

We characterize the last iterate convergence rate of mirror methods in variational inequalities as a function of the local geometry near the solution, both in deterministic ([to be published in SIOPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08043)) and stochastic settings ([COLT 21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01906)).
