I am a PhD student in machine learning and optimization at the [LJK lab](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/) within [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Franck Iutzeler](https://www.iutzeler.org/), [Jérôme Malick](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Jerome.Malick/), and [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](https://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/).
Before starting my PhD, I studied at [ENS Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) and graduated from the [MVA master](https://www.master-mva.com/).

The aim of my research is two-fold: (i) advancing our understanding of the intricate phenomena at play in deep learning, using tools from optimization, dynamical systems, probability and statistics; (ii) leveraging this knowledge to deliver more reliable and efficient machine learning systems.

### Research Focus

My research spans four main areas that contribute to a principled understanding of deep learning systems and their optimization dynamics.
Details on each research area live on the [projects page](/projects/).
