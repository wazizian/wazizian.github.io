I regularly serve as a teaching assistant for undergraduate and graduate courses at Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA) and ENSIMAG. Below is a condensed log of recent duties; feel free to reach out if you need lecture notes or exercise sheets.

## Academic year 2024–2025

- **Statistics for Biology** (Licence 2, UGA) — 16.5 hours of recitations on probabilistic modeling and experimental data analysis.

## Academic year 2023–2024

- **Statistics for Biology** (Licence 2, UGA) — repeated the second-year bachelor module with refreshed case studies.
- **Numerical Optimization** (MSIAM M1, UGA) — 18 hours of exercise sessions covering gradient methods, convexity, and Python/Numpy labs.

## Academic year 2022–2023

- **Numerical Optimization** (MSIAM M1, UGA) — 20.5 hours of combined practicals and exercises on smooth and stochastic optimization.
- **Refresher on Optimization** (Master 2, UGA) — 6-hour intensive block on convex analysis and duality.
- **Numerical Optimization** (ENSIMAG 2nd year) — 16.5 hours of Python/Numpy practicals and board sessions centered on constrained optimization.
- **Numerical Analysis** (ENSIMAG 1st year) — 12 hours of labs introducing differential equation solvers and stability considerations.
- **Basic Numerical Methods** (ENSIMAG 1st year) — 6 hours of recitations on interpolation, quadrature, and linear systems.

These activities complement my supervision of junior researchers on optimization and robust learning projects.
